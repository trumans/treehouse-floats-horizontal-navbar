This is based on a practice exercise on floating elements and horizontal navigation bars

floats.css contains the rules that create that float elements and make nav bars horizontal

styles-floats.css contains the rules for overall presentation.

The nav bar at the top floats the line items.
The nav bar at the bottom uses inline-block display on the line items

The first section contains an image that is floated to the right with text wrapping around it.

The second and third sections contain an image floated to the left and text on its right that does not wrap around the image.
